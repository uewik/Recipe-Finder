This Rails web application provides web page access to recipe information served by http://food2fork.com/api through JSON and images.

Web application has been deployed to Heroku at: recipefinder880125.herokuapp.com.  I implemented searching function by modifying URL. The searching recipe is chocolate by default (because I like chocolcate:)). You can search different recipe by appending URL "/?search=searchitem", for example if I try to search recipe for mocha, I will modify URL like this:
http://recipefinder880125.herokuapp.com/?search=mocha

Give it a try at http://recipefinder880125.herokuapp.com/ (expired)
